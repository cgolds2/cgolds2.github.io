                        Volkey is a Volitility plugin that we created in order to assist memory forensic analysis.  Volitility is a python program that can run many operations on memory images, operations such as finding the running processes or looking at virtual memory.  Our plugin runs on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) images and will escalate the running bash shells to root.  This is done by finding the process, where the corresponding user information lies in memory, and changing the applicable values to that of a root user.  From there, the person doing the analysis can have full control of the machine and make themselves persistent root if they so choose.

                        Pentago is an abstract strategy game for two players with four 3×3 grids arranged into a larger 6×6 grid. This game re-implements the well-known Connect 4 with a twist: After placing a marble, the player has to twist one of the grids by 90°, thus changing the board after every move.<br>
                        Our project was 3 fold.  First, we implemented pentago as a command-line game.  Next we designed a manual heuristic that could play against human players.  Finally we designed a Neural Network that could have a stronger win percentage than the Neural Network.

                        and defeating bosses. The levels are procedurally generated so they are different each time, and the player wins after clearing all the levels, and beating the final boss at the end.

                        While using my computer one day, I realized that sometimes there are issues when plugging in different displays.  Rather than go into the display setting each time, I thought there had to be an easier way to change to a set profile.  Therefore, I made this program to simply change the display information just as the Windows setting would, but instead you can simply bind the corresponding actions to a taskbar icon.

                        In the US government, there often is heavy discombobulation when it comes to being on the same page.  This happens at every level, from federal to local, however at the federal level miscommunication can be extremely obvious when it comes to people across the country being on different pages.  This project addressed a problem that had to do with emergency resource management.  Basically, when an emergency occurs, different entities need to communicate with each other to exchange resources and help each other out.  The problem came when the realization hit that there was no regulation for what the entities had to use to communicate with each other.  This meant that, when a disaster hit (example being Katrina) there was a giant mess of miscommunication as resources wouldn’t get requested or delivered.  To address this issue, a standard was created for all entities to use so that they could effectively communicate with each other, however nothing enforced this, so lots did not use it and just kept using the same, older system.  Therefore, the goal of this project was to make one uniform system that could take in any type of request and translate it into each of the systems.  This meant that any entity could create a message, and any other entity could receive it.

                        PawPrints is a shelter management system that aids animal shelters in organizing and maintaining their information. The system is composed of three parts: a database, a desktop app, and a website. These three parts combine to create a flexible, organized system that allows shelters to easily engineer a system tailored to their unique needs. While other systems that provide similar functionality exist, PawPrints stands apart in terms of user friendliness and flexibility.
